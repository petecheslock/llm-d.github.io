 * Remote Content Plugin System

 * To add new remote content:
 * 1. Create a new file in remote-sources/DIRECTORY/ (architecture/, guide/, or community/)
 * 2. Import it below in the appropriate section
 * 3. Add it to the remoteContentPlugins array
 * 
 * Users can manage their own plugins separately in docusaurus.config.js
