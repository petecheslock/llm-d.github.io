# build-all.sh — Unified build script for local dev, Netlify, and GitHub Actions
#
# Layout produced:
#   build/                  — main site (landing, blog, community)
#   build/docs/             — latest stable release docs (canonical URL)
#   build/docs/{version}/   — every release-X.Y.Z branch (stable deep-links)
#   build/docs/dev/         — development docs from llm-d/llm-d@<DEV_DOCS_BRANCH>
#
# If no release-X.Y.Z branches exist yet, dev docs are served at build/docs/
# (preserving the historical pre-release behavior).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build-all.sh                                        # dev docs from llm-d/llm-d@main
#   ./scripts/build-all.sh release-0.7                            # dev docs from a different branch
#   LLMD_REPO=/path/to/local/llm-d ./scripts/build-all.sh         # use local clone as-is
#   LLMD_REPO=/path/to/local/llm-d LLMD_FETCH=1 ./scripts/build-all.sh  # fetch before sync
