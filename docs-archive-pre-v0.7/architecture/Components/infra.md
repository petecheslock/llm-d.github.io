# `llm-d-infra`

This repository provides the Kubernetes infrastructure components, Helm charts, and operational tooling for deploying [llm-d](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d) - a Kubernetes-native high-performance distributed LLM inference framework.

## What This Repository Contains

**Infrastructure Components:**

- Helm charts for deploying llm-d gateway infrastructure
- Kubernetes Gateway API configurations with support for Istio,
  [agentgateway](https://agentgateway.dev/), and GKE
- `kgateway` compatibility mode for inference, deprecated in favor of
  standalone `agentgateway` and scheduled for removal in the next llm-d release
- Service mesh integration and traffic management policies

**Operational Tooling:**

- Interactive benchmarking and testing utilities
- Smoke testing scripts for deployment validation
- Development helpers and automation tools

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.28+ cluster
- Helm 3.10+
- Gateway API v1.4.0+ installed
- Gateway controller (Istio, agentgateway, or GKE) deployed in your cluster
- `kgateway` remains supported as a deprecated compatibility mode and install
  path and will be removed in the next llm-d release in favor of standalone
  `agentgateway`

### Install llm-d Infrastructure

```bash
# Add the Helm repository
helm repo add llm-d-infra https://llm-d-incubation.github.io/llm-d-infra/
helm repo update

# Install the infrastructure components
helm install my-llm-d-infra llm-d-infra/llm-d-infra
```
